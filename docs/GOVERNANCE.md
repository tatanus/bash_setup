# Governance

The project uses a **maintainer model** with open community input.

## Roles
- **Contributors**: Anyone opening issues/PRs.
- **Reviewers**: Contributors with review privileges.
- **Maintainers**: Merge, release, and roadmap authority.

## Decision making
- Routine changes: *lazy consensus* on PRs.
- If consensus fails: simple majority of maintainers.
- Breaking changes or roadmap shifts: open an RFC issue; require at least two maintainer approvals.

## Processes
- **Releases**: See `RELEASING.md` (SemVer).
- **Security**: Private reporting; see `SECURITY.md`.
- **Code of Conduct**: Contributor Covenant; enforced by maintainers.
- **Contribution guidelines**: See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Changes to this document
- Propose via PR; requires maintainer approval.
